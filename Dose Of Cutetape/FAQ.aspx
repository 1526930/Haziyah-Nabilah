        <p class="text3">Why are some Washi Tape different sizes?</p>
        <pre>For the MT Brand, the size will be 10m in length going forward.
        The reason being that, it is the decision of the MT company and because there is an exclusive distributor for the US.
        Hence all the Washi Tape from this brand will be 10m in length for legitimate vendors.
        Other Brands will remain at 15m unless noted otherwise.</pre></li>

        <p class="text4">How come I can only add up to quantity 3 for items?</p>
        <pre>I've set most items for maximum of 3 allowed to be added to the cart. This helps me keep track of inventory and decreases the chance that
            I will oversell something.It doesn't have to mean I only have 3, although sometimes an item might be low in stock.If you need something 
            in quantity higher than 3, feel free to use the contact form to let me know & I'll check the stock and will let you know if more than 
            3 are available.</pre>

        <p class="text5">How long does it take for my order to arrive?</p>
        <pre>You can check the customer service page for more detailed shipping information. For Brunei purchases, it takes about 3-5 business days after 
            the order is taken in.For International orders, it takes average of 9-15 business days after order is shipped, which means it can be faster 
            or it can take longer. Mostly depending on how quickly your country's customs clear your package.The above is the shipping time after a 
            package goes out, so remember that there is also processing time which is usually 23 days after the order is received & payment has been 
            confirmed.***Holiday seasons may differ and may take longer, so please keep that in mind.***</pre>
